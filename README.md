# subnode
aggregated proxy for sub-archive-nodes of tendermint/cosmos chains

![Subnode Architecture](doc/architecture.png)


Archive node data is big, major chains could grow 5TB/year and will stop working at some point.


This project is to make archive node could scale forever by breaking data into multiple smaller nodes (called sub-node).
Each subnode stores data of 5 millions blocks or 5 TB. Old subnodes are read-only.


As data is spreaded over multiple sub-nodes, its required to have a proxy which aggreates data from sub-nodes and provides compatible rpc/api.

#### Supported Protocols
- [Tendermint RPC/JSONRPC](doc/rpc.md) on port 26657
- LCD/API on port 1337
- GRPC on port 9090
- [Eth JsonRpc](doc/ethereum-json-rpc.md) on port 8545


### Usage
install:
```console
make install
```


start:
```console
subnode start --conf=/path/to/config/file
```

#### Configuration
See sample config [test.config.evmos.yaml](test.config.evmos.yaml).

`blocks` config example:
- `[1, 100]` => from block 1 to block 100 (subnode). In case its last subnode, set to-block to 0 to indicate newest block `[101, 0]`
- `[10]` => last 10 recent blocks (for pruned node)
- `[]` => for archive node

Node on the top of the list has higher priority when selecting.
